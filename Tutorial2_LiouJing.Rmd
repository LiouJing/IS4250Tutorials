# 1(a)(i) To get the mean of the WaitTime
summarise(labs, ans = mean(WaitTime, na.rm = TRUE))

# Count the number of Yes and No for service satisfaction 
count(labs, SvcSat)

# 1(a)(ii) Plot the graph for WaitTime
qplot(data=labs, x=WaitTime)

# Plot the graph for Service Satisfaction
qplot(data=labs, x=SvcSat)

# 1(b)
# Service Sat vs Age
plot(labs$SvcSat,labs$AGE)
#From this, you can see that most of the Ys come from the younger people, while most of the Ns come from the older people.

# Service Sat vs Gender 
plot(labs$SvcSat,labs$Gender)
# From this, you can tell that although both females and males are mostly happy with the service, the females are happier compared to males, as there are more Ys for females.
